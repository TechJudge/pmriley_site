        <p>Just relearning HTML, CSS and JS.<br> I originally learned them when I got my Associates in graphic design.<br>I finally realize that web design is what I want to do.</p>
        
        <h2>You Have To Restart Somewhere</h2>
        <p>I know right now my page is very basic, but I will continue to build it.<br> Next step is adding and image, a menu and some of my practice code and previous design work.</p>
