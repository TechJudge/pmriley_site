    <h3>Beginner Front End Developer</h3>

    <p>I am relearning HTML and CSS, and learning JavaScript.<br>
       When I was in school to get my Associate in graphic design, I learned HTML 4 and CSS.
    </p>

         <p>Next, I received my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, with a focus on Computer Science.<br>
            And that's brings me here, I decided to use the Computer Science side of my degree and pursue Front-End Development.
         </p>

             <p>
             I learned other languages during my journey, such as mySQL, .NET and C. <br>
             While I did enjoy coding in those languages and enjoyed the challenge, my journey has brought me back full circle.
